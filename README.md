This project was more or less a coding for a banking investmesnt software. It is meant to help calculate investments. I think I was able to do the design fairly well. C++ has been very hard for me, and I kind of gave up when it came to C++ and python being used together. I think I could enhance it in maybe short cutting some of the coding. I am not to sure though. I found the functions to call to other files hard for me. Java was the other language I used that did this and it was not that easy for me in java. The tools and resources I would add are indeed github and stackoverflow. The coding community has a lot of nice people who help streamline coding. I feel that this project will help with other projects in the fact that having a menu to call other functions is most likely going to be very common. I made this maintainable and readable by simply using the // (double slash) to help clarify what each line of code does.
